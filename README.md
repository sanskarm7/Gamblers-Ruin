This Java program simulates a betting game where players guess a number between 0 and 100 and wager a specified amount. The game incorporates chance and strategy, adjusting the player's money based on the guessed number's relation to a randomly generated target. The code employs a simple console interface, capturing user inputs for the initial amount, desired winning amount, and betting details. The game continues until the player either reaches the winning amount or runs out of money.
